# Report on Software Metrics

The metrics we got were from Intellij, and the pluggins statistic for lines of source code and comment lines, and codeMR for complexity metrics.



In respect to lines of code and comment lines, we could only conclude that our code is well commented, since there are comments, but the ratio is not too high in our opinion at 24% of the total line count, counting with empty lines (14%).



Our code in theory could be a better implementation of the class game since this class has a medium-high complexity.

Every other class has a low complexity.
